  "summary": "Core Valentine chat UI, styling, and interactive button-driven chat behavior appear implemented (gradient background, centered card, scrollable chat, auto-scroll, 700ms bot replies, third button label). However, unrequested authentication/actor infrastructure and a promotional footer were added, and one bot reply string differs in apostrophe style from the specified acceptance text.",

      "reason": "The implemented bot reply uses a straight apostrophe (\"That's\") instead of the specified curly apostrophe (\"That’s\"), so it does not match the acceptance text exactly.",
